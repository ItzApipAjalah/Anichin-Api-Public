# Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This project is designed to scrape data from the website [Anichin](https://anichin.live). It extracts details about anime series and their episodes. The scraped data includes series details such as titles, ratings, and descriptions, as well as a list of episodes with their links and dates.

## Privacy Notice

**Important:** This scraping code is intended for private use only. To protect the integrity of this code and prevent unauthorized use, the scraping method has been intentionally obfuscated. Specifically, certain parts of the code have been altered to make it more difficult for others to replicate. 

For example, the code snippet:
```javascript
$('find it at https://anichin.live/').each((index, element) => {
    // scraping logic here
});
```
has been used to prevent code theft and ensure the proprietary nature of this implementation.
